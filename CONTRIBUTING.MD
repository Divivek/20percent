- Other important documentation about 20Percent can be found in the project wiki: [Project Wiki](https://github.com/crisisboard/20Percent/wiki)

If you'd like to fix a bug or pick up a feature request, please read the below guide on how to do that.

## Code Contributions (Getting Started Guide)

If you are unfamiliar with contributing to open-source software, feel free to familiarize yourself with the process by reading [this guide](https://codeburst.io/a-step-by-step-guide-to-making-your-first-github-contribution-5302260a2940). This process is also outlined below.

Start by picking an issue to work on and assigning yourself. [(Issues)](https://github.com/crisisboard/20Percent/issues)

If you don't understand what an issue is asking for, feel free to get in touch with us. Generally, the best way is to comment on the issue. If you are serious about becoming a continuous contributor, feel free to ask for an invite to our slack team.

Once you have an idea of what you're doing:

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the repository
3. Create a new branch for your bug fix/feature. Name your branch `bug/<issue-name>` or `feature/<issue-name>` for organizational purposes.
4. Make your necessary changes and commit them.
5. Push your branches to Github.
6. Submit a pull request for review. Pull Requests can be submitted from the Pull Requests page. [Pull Requests](https://github.com/crisisboard/20Percent/pulls)

## Code review/merging process

After you've self-reviewed your code and opened a pull request, assign it to a maintainer (preferably one who works in that feature area, whether it's frontend, backend, maps-specific, etc).

TBD for code-style guidelines and merging process (CI/CD? Single/Multi-approval required? Squashed commits? etc) - add to this doc in later PR

## How to file a quality bug report

There are a few key parts to a helpful bug report:

- Relevant information such as version numbers, server environments, code files affected, etc
- Detailed steps to reproduce it: provide details about what you were doing when you found the bug
- Screenshots of incorrect output and error dumps

## How to file a quality feature request

When creating a feature request, please follow these steps:

1. Make sure it isn't already on our product roadmap. This can be found in the [readme](https://github.com/crisisboard/20Percent/blob/master/README.md) under the heading "Path for Future Work".
2. Ensure that it's detailed and specific enough. Think about whether it's a frontend/backend/full-stack feature, how high-priority it is, whether it requires testing and what sort of testing it might require, etc and include these details in your request.
3. Create an issue for it, [Create an issue](https://github.com/crisisboard/20Percent/issues/new) then label it as an "enhancement".

That's about it!
